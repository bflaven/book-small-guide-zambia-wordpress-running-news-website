## Foreword

It all started with a double injunction: on the one hand holding a training course in Zambia on behalf of the ZNBC and on the other hand my designation as P.O on a backoffice.

1. The training required me to transcribe in an intuitive and operational way all the know-how patiently gathered about digital project management with Agile Scrum, retaining a maximum of requirements and good practices. To spice up the exercise, it had to be done under constraints as budget, technics and human resources were not the same. This is the subject of Book 1 of this trilogy.


2. My experience in P.O forced me to take a strong interest in testing. The idea was to overcome with "agility" one of the most difficult obstacle for a webapplication (backoffice, website): user acceptance testing. In comparison to this testing issue, the design and evolution of a web application seems almost easier! Indeed, how to minimize the risk of this acceptance phase, to limit it in time and to limit its "toxicity" in order to avoid regressions or side effects. In short, that each GO turns into a nightmare! Whether it is a collective responsibility changes nothing! What is a P.O worth if he/she is unable to ensure that the product quality is acceptable? This is the subject of books 2 and 3 of this trilogy.

## Acknowledgments

For book #2 & book #3, after a quick benchmark of the market solutions and the constraints that were mine, I totally relied on Codeception and CodeceptJS. I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank the the Codeception (CP) and CodeceptJS (CPJS) team's excellent work and the remarkable documentation that accompanies it. Without this documentation, I believe that I would not have taken such a step.

## Book Introduction

**It begins in Zambia**

I was asked to make a training session in Zambia for the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) about all the best practices of the digital department in the media group France Médias Monde (FMM) that I am working for. It occurs to me that it was not so easy to transpose what is done in terms of organization, work-ﬂow and best practices from one company to another.

Fortunately, the ZNBC website is using WordPress so I had to list any of these best practices and transpose it to a WordPress development.

This book is the result of the inquiry to transpose all the investigations to a comprehensive guide and presentation to manage in a modern way an API centric ecosystem both for website and mobile application. It was indeed to also a way to make a skills assessment on my own experience.

Like always this book does not have the purpose to deliver a theoretical knowledge or to teach you programming but only to provide a true handbook for someone with a light technical background but with a strong professional interest to run a successful news website through WordPress.

More over without neglecting any technical aspects, I wanted to give the means to anyone to investigate all feasible developments for a WP website with all the market's requirements in force in the development area.


The digital department where I worked is composed by several teams with an agile-based organization (sprint, dashboards, stakeholders, PO, rituals... and so on). These teams are handling software development, mostly in PHP Framework like Symfony for website, API and Back-ofﬁce and some native developers on mobile application both iOS and Android. Unfortunately, not everyone can afford such means, that was the case for the training in Zambia, necessity is the mother of invention! With the minimum, the challenge was to achieve the feat of being to reach the level of quality of sites like notable Big Name Brands that are using WordPress: TechCrunch, The New Yorker, BBC America, Bloomberg Professional., The Ofﬁcial Star Wars Blog, Variety, Sony Music, MTV News...

That was the state of mind that prevailed during the preparation of this training session and for this book.

## Code
**I try not to forget anything. The best thing to do is to make a fresh installation of CodeCeption (CP), finalize the configuration and then cut and paste the testing files one after the other with a WP running on custom URL in MAMP.**
